It was a hard rain, a perpetual rain, a sweating and steaming rain; a downpour, a fountain, an undertow at the ankles; it was a rain to drown all rains and the memory of rains. It came by the pound and the ton, it hacked at the jungle and cut the trees like scissors and shaved the grass and tunneled the soil and molted the bushes. It shrank menâ€™s hands into the hands of wrinkled apes; it rained a solid glassy rain, and it never stopped.
